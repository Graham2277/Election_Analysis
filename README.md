## Election-Audit Summary:
The current script works well to analyze the election data. If data is altered, the script can easily and quickly be ran again to get new outcomes. However, it could be improved upon. One change would be to add in a “check feature” that would ensure the data is being counted accurately. Another change would be to alter the “county” variable and terms to something more universal like “location” so that the script can be more easily applied and understood for other elections.
